hi, i'm mahdy 👋

i like building things on the internet.

sometimes it's a small script, sometimes a saas idea,
most of the time it's just me learning by doing.

---

### what you'll find here

- random experiments
- tools i needed and built
- half-finished ideas
- things i'm currently learning

---

### tech i use (depends on the mood)

python • node • javascript  
ai tools • automation • backend stuff  

not loyal to any stack, just use what works.

---

### currently

learning, building, breaking, fixing. repeat.

---

### why this github exists

to document what i try and what i learn.  
nothing polished, just progress.
